This is experimental implementation of dicom scp simulators using DCMTK

    mppsrecv - Modality Performed Procedure Step SCP

        - receive N-CREATE Request and send back N-CREATE Response
        - receive N-SET Request and send back N-SET Response

    storcmtrecv - Storage Commitment SCP

        - receive N-ACTION Request and send back N-ACTION Response
        - send N-EVENT-REPORT Request in the same association with N-ACTION Response
          if association is closed within 5 sec, otherwise send N-EVENT-REPORT Request 
          in new association.

All codes are developed based on DCMTK source codes

Requirements: 

+ DCMTK 3.6.6 
  dcmtk-3.6.6 should be built separately and installed under /usr/local directory 

Notes:

+  It is only tested on OpenSUSE Leap 15.3

Usage:

    % mppsrecv -aet <AETitle> <port number>
    
    % storcmtrecv -cwt <commit wait timeout> -p <Peer Port>  -aet <AETitle> <port number>
